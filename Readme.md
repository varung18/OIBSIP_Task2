This project "Guess the Number" allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer & involves the following steps:
1. The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100
2. The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialouge box.
3. The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number.
4. The Game continues under the user guessing the number, within a certain limit.
5. The rounds are added as a reset.
